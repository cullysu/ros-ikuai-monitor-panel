- latestRecordedStep: `879`
- latestStepOutcome: `879:current-sha-evidence-rebound`
- currentConclusion: **FAIL overall**. Exact-SHA engineering evidence and fresh scoped Product/Design/Visual/Accessibility reviews are green in declared scope; Route Owner/Operations formally fails the maturity boundary; formal trusted acceptance, route maturity, RouterOS soak and release evidence remain open.

## Loop refinement applied

- `emil-design-eng` was installed from `emilkowalski/skills` and fused into the product-company loop through `C:\Users\cully\.codex\skills\product-company-loop\references\emil-design-eng-gate.md`.
- The operational rule is restraint: motion cannot invent freshness or urgency, and static evidence remains preferred for metrics, alerts, timestamps, and charts.

## Current handoff: Step 879 exact-SHA evidence rebound; formal gates remain open

- Result: amended clean SHA 23a51a01ece0bfff7e396c44766ec1d1996c7af6 owns fresh runtime and matrix/report families; packet remains prepared-not-signed and route maturity remains incomplete.
- Decision: keep product release FAIL-closed, preserve bounded route semantics, keep scoped Product/Design/Visual/Interaction review separate from trusted acceptance, and require a fresh clean SHA for every matrix family. The task is active and `blocked=false` while trusted acceptance, route maturity, RouterOS soak and exact-SHA CL remain executable.
- Boundary: route maturity is 0 complete / 18 bounded-readonly / 0 fallback / 1 unavailable. Formal product/design/visual/accessibility acceptance, Route Owner, RouterOS soak, exact-SHA CL and public release remain fail-closed.
- Next: continue independent Product/Design/Visual/Accessibility acceptance, Route Owner, RouterOS soak and exact-SHA external CL before any GitHub publication.
## Historical handoff: Step857 (superseded by Step858)

- Result: amended clean SHA 23a51a01ece0bfff7e396c44766ec1d1996c7af6 owns fresh runtime and matrix/report families; packet remains prepared-not-signed and route maturity remains incomplete.
- Decision: close the local scoped visual/design/product/accessibility boundary, but keep the packet `prepared-not-signed` and do not convert scoped review into trusted external signoff. The prior blocked marker was incorrect; this task remains active and `blocked=false`.
- Boundary: strict readiness remains `0 complete / 18 bounded-readonly / 0 fallback / 1 unavailable`; formal trusted acceptance, route-owner acceptance, real RouterOS soak, exact-SHA Linux/Windows/GHCR CL and GitHub publication remain open/closed as appropriate.
- Next: continue independent Product/Design/Visual/Accessibility acceptance, Route Owner, RouterOS soak and exact-SHA external CL before any GitHub publication.

## Gate boundary

| Gate | Status | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| Product | pending | Route maturity and trusted owner acceptance remain open. |
| Design review | scoped-pass / formal-pending | Exact-SHA Hooke review P0/P1=0; trusted public signature is not present. |
| Visual review | scoped-pass / formal-pending | Exact-SHA Hooke review P0/P1=0; trusted public signature is not present. |
| Route maturity | pending | 0 complete / 18 bounded-readonly / 0 fallback / 1 unavailable. |
| Accessibility | scoped-pass / formal-pending | Fresh exact-SHA scoped review found P0/P1=0; formal trusted assistive-technology acceptance is not signed. |
| Current product release | `fail` |
| GitHub / public release | closed | No upload or publication approval. |

## Step849 continuation

Do not mark this task blocked. Continue the remaining non-forgeable route-owner, RouterOS and exact-SHA CL gates; the route-object depth commit requires a fresh exact-SHA rebind.
